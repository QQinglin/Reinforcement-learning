- [x] Model-free Control (SARSA and Q-Learning)
- [x] Value Function Approximation (Deep Q-Networks)
- [x] Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (Vanilla Policy Gradient VPG) 
- [x] Actor-Critic Methods (Advantage Actor-Critic A2C)
- [x] PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) 
- [x] DDPG (Deep determinstic policy gradient)
- [x] SAC (Soft Actor Critc)
